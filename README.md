# Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my little corner on GitHub! I'm Nat, and I'm on a journey to build an awesome portfolio while soaking up knowledge like a sponge. Currently honing my skills over at [freecode.org](https://freecodecamp.org) - freecodecamp.org/nat-j-can

## ðŸ”­ What I'm up to

Right now, I'm all about building my portfolio. I'm not a lone wolfâ€”I'm on the lookout for opportunities to learn and grow within a team.

## ðŸŒ± Learning the ropes

You'll often find me knee-deep in the world of Javascript, Ruby and Python. If you're working on projects in these languages or have some cool ideas, count me in! Collaboration is where the magic happens, and I'm ready to try to bring my A-game.

## ðŸ‘¯ Let's collaborate!

I'm open to collaborations on anything related to Ruby or Python. Got an idea or project in mind? Let's chat and see how we can create something amazing together.

## ðŸ¤” Seeking guidance and mentorship

I believe in the power of mentorship. If you're a seasoned developer willing to share your wisdom, or if you just want to geek out over code together, I'm all ears. Let's connect and learn from each other.

## ðŸ’¬ Fun Chats

Away from the screen, ask me about my fur babiesâ€”my dog and cat. They're my coding companions, and we make a paw-some team! Oh, and did I mention my love for whiskey? Let's share some stories and recommendations.

## ðŸ“« How to reach me

Here on GitHub is a great start! Feel free to drop me a message or reach out. I'm always up for a good coding discussion or just a friendly chat.

## ðŸ˜„ Pronouns

She/her

## âš¡ Fun fact

You might catch me crushing it in word games or reliving the glory days with NFL Blitz on N64. Got a favorite word game or a fond memory of classic gaming? Let's swap stories!

Thanks for stopping by ðŸš€
